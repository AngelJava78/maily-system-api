# Specification Quality Checklist: Tipo de suscripción (Individual o Empresarial)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed: the one point with real ambiguity (who rejects a
  second clinic on an Individual subscription) has a reasonable default grounded in the ratified
  constitution (Principle IX) and the current codebase, where clinic-to-subscription association is
  already owned by an external system, not by this API. It is documented in Assumptions and in
  FR-006/FR-007 rather than left open.
